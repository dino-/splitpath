# splitpath


## Synopsis

Safely split paths in many ways (Haskell)


## Description

A tool for splitting paths that's more reliable and straightforward than the
usual combination of `basename` and bash built-ins like `##*.` and `%.*`. This
tool has smarter support for extensions and spaces as well.


## Getting source

Source code is available from github at the
[splitpath](https://github.com/dino-/splitpath) project page.
